WELCOME TO PHYLICIA's Portfolio

In this project, I worked with a variety of mock datasets to demonstrate my ability to apply SQL in hands-on, real-world scenarios. The challenges included answering business-focused questions by writing clear and effective queries.

ðŸ’¡ Objective: To build fluency in SQL by solving a range of data problems â€” and to showcase my growing skillset in data analysis through clean, efficient code.

This project reflects my commitment to continuous learning and growth as a data professional.
